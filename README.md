# new_years_companion
An app that blends dddance.party, spotify, and wikipedia into an ungody new years countdown and recap machine.

Recommended usage: place on an obnoxiously large screen from the hours of 8pm to 12:01am New Years Eve.

Currently configured for the 2019 - 2020 transition.

### Getting Started

1. Get Pumped.
2. `npm install` & `npm start` you know da deal
3. Navigate like a salty sea dog to `localhost:5000/login`. This will connect the app to what you're currently playing on spotify. The [definitive best-of-2019-playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5zCCejpDV9ti90MSA6xZrt?si=l5zKPfALRaOf5FMD_77nsg) is recommended.
4. Configure your dancers using the lovely dddance.party.
5. Fullscreen and enjoy your party.
